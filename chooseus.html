  <title> Why we are the best fit for the YPI project!</title>
  <h1>Why we beleive we are the best choice for the YPI project!</h1>
    <p> We donâ€™t just believe our charity is the best fit for YPI, we know it is. Our charity focuses on poverty within aborignal reserves, or more specifically giving aboriginal children the best possible life. Their main focus is to bring down the alarming percentage of poverty in reserves(60%), as quickly as possible. They want to make ever lasting change for aborignal children now and the aboriginal children to come. They want to provide food, water, health, and housing. They want to create hope, education, and self determination.

     Most importantly they want us to reconcile the past actions of Canada and take action to help the people who inhabited the land before you. Our goal for the charity is very similar to YPI. Both charities' goal is to empower the youth. YPI does this by giving the youth money to help others. True North Aid does this by providing the younger generations with the greatest task of all; Kids helping kids.
